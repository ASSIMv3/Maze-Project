# 3D Ray Casting Game

This project is a 3D ray casting game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It simulates a first-person perspective in a maze-like environment, where the player can navigate and explore the surroundings.

## Overview

The 3D ray casting game is inspired by classic first-person shooter games and serves as a simple demonstration of ray casting techniques to create a pseudo-3D effect. The project is organized into modular components, providing clarity and ease of maintenance.
